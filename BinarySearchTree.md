Write the Binary-Search-Tree stages of the sequence [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2].

1.Write the stages of the above sequence according to the sort type.
Example: root is x. y is found to the right of root. To its left is a z, etc.

Binary-Search-Tree Stages of Binary Search Tree [7,5,1,8,3,6,0,9,4,2]

** Root is 7.

** Since 5 is less than 7, it is located to the left of root.

** Since 1 is less than 7 and 5, it is to the left of 5.

** 8 is to the right of 7 because it is greater than 7.

** 3 is less than 7 and less than 5; It is located to the right of 1 because it is greater than 1.

** 6 is to the right of 5 because it is less than 7 and greater than 5.

** 0 is to the left of the previous smallest number, 1, because it is less than all of them.

** 9 is to the right of 8, the largest number before it, because it is greater than all of them.

** less than 4, 7, and 5; It is located to the right of 3 because it is greater than 1 and 3.

** Less than 2, 7, and 5; It is located to the left of 3 because it is greater than 1 and less than 3.
