# Classification Vs Regression
## Classification

Classification means classifying objects according to their specific properties. For example, two different classes can be created as animals and items. These classes, for example, are animals within themselves; These sub-headings can be divided into two sub-headings such as those who live in water and those who live on land. The important thing here is that the classifications show similar characteristics. As a result of this classification process, differentiation can be made by looking at the basic structures.

## Regression

Regression is used for predicted values. It is used to relate two or more quantitative values. For example, values ​​such as the price of a house and the height of a person can be quoted as regressions. They are not separated by classification within strict limits.
